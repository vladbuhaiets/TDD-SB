Additional code,Soldier!
Given one input string as "1 2 3 4 5;6 7 8 9 10;11 12 13 14 15"(it's 3 lists)
1.String[] sets consists of these lists. Add all elements from each list to correct set(see the comments in the code) sets[0] = {"1 2 3 4 5"} - its string and so on
*use split(" ") to separate elements from string
2.On unionTreeLargeNumber(Set<Integer> set1,Set<Integer> set2,Set<Integer> set3):
     1)In each Set find the maximum element
     2)create TreeSet, add the resulting elements to TreeSet
     3)return this TreeSet with elements sorted in descending order:
            you can use special method from class TreeSet or rather NavigableSet interface to change the order of storage on the reverse
3.Using System.out.println() print elements of resultTreeSet
